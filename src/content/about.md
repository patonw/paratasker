## Introduction
Each task is a closed circuit. The intent of this format is to allow
you to make multiple attempts in a session.
Furthermore, when you have accomplished a task, you should do it again
back to back, improving your technique with each repetition.
Start working on to the next set of tasks when you feel comfortable
 with the current level.

You should not switch over abruptly, but include more challenging tasks into
your flights.  Not everyone learns at the same rate.  Not all tasks lumped
together will be exactly/remotely equal.  If you find yourself mastering a task
too easily consider how you can make it "interesting" and contribute back by
suggesting variations or modifications.

## Limitations
These tasks are primarily focused on developing technical skill.
You still need to find other sources for weather knowledge, route planning and strategy.
Read as much as you can. Ask around.  Other pilots will be eager to share their books and magazines.

Some books you might want on your shelf:
  - Thermal Flying by Burkhard Martens
  - Fifty Ways to Fly Better by Bruce Goldsmith
  - Mastering Paragliding by Kelly Farina
  - Understanding the Sky by Dennis Pagen

Take a copy of USHPA or Cross Country magazine to read while parawaiting.

## Time limits
Take your time...

The time limits are not set to rush or penalize you.
Rather they are targets to measure your progress against in the absence of competition
or instructors yelling on the radio.
Don't expect to nail a task within the time limit on your first try.
Concentrate on finishing the task first.  Then reflect on how you can improve and try again.

## Contributing
Please submit your ideas for tasks and comment on existing ones.
If you want to capture someone else's ideas, list them as a contributor.
Feel free to edit task descriptions to clarify specific points or 
trim down excess verbiage.
Don't worry too much about the format.
I'll fix formatting errors as long as the relevant data is in the file.

The primary benefit of this project should the insights the flying community provides.
However, be considerate to your target audience. Avoid making tasks unnecessarily 
complicated even if they are technically easy.

## Format
The task descriptions are contained in markdown formatted files.
This is close enough to plain text such that special tools are unnecessary.
Each task has an initial summary followed by a description divided into four parts:
  - Objectives
  - Walkthrough
  - Hazards
  - Tips

The objectives section lists skills the task is designed to improve.
Flying around aimlessly is enjoyable but if you want to improve, you must focus.
*Walkthrough* contains step-by-step instructions of how you can typically achieve the task.
Of course, in paragliding there is no such thing as "typical"
so a step-by-step list is still just an outline.

Hazards lists things you will need to watch out for. Most of these are common sense,
but it can be easy to overlook them when focusing on a task.
In the tips section, there are insights that are not specific to any
step in the walkthrough but are relevant to the task.

The task metadata is formatted as a YAML header (a.k.a. frontmatter) before the description.
YAML can also be read and authored without special tools but it is machine readable,
making it possible to render tasks into maps and GPS files.
Unfortunately the metadata has to appear at the top of the file.
If you're reading the task just skip it and read the description.

## Roadmap
Tooling to convert task metadata into GPS files is forthcoming.

We will need more people to contribute tasks and some test subjects to provide feedback.

Any suggestions beyond that?
