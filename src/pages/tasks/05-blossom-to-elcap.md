This is a classic route for Blossom but it can be a little daunting for lower airtime pilots
so ask a regular to fly with you. There are usually pilots there most afternoons, year round.

You will be crossing a valley into no-man's land, working upwind then crossing back.

## Objectives
1. Valley crossings
2. Mixed thermic/dynamic lift

## Walkthrough

## Hazards
First and foremost, the biggest danger is the high voltage powerline that spans the
northern edge of valley along through the base of El Capitan. The anabatic flow up
the face is relatively smooth but there will often be strong thermals punching through
at the numerous trigger points.  It is important to keep a healthy distance from the
terrain.

At the southern end the valley flow can sometimes compress along the
base of the ridge and cause venturi up to about a third of the way up.  The lift
near the end of the ridge usually isn't as good as in the middle so this area should
be avoided regardless.

On occassion, there will be moderate air traffic through the valley with
civilian and military helicopters and small planes.
