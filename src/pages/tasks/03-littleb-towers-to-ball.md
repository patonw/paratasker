Little Black is a great site to start thermal flying if you don't mind a quick hiking.

## Objectives
1. Hopping between thermal triggers
2. Gliding with a headwind or tailwind
3. Learning to love the hike & fly

## Description

Because there is not much altitude to work with, you'll have to pick a good
cycle to launch or risk getting flushed.
Luckily, the hike is fairly short. I would recommend bringing a rosette-style
stuff sack to minimize packing time.  In this task you will be working your way
up the ridge between each launch and pushing out with a headwind glide.

After launching you will want to thermal above launch until you are level with the 500.
Hop over to spines and work the lift back over to the 500.
From there you should be able to track thermals up the main ridge all the way to the towers.

## Hazards
Obviously don't fly into the towers. The actual towers launch waypoint is on the trail in front of the them.

The spines can generate a bit of rotor when the wind is southwest so aim for a point that gives you a lot of clearance.
You do not need to scratch along the terrain to reach the next waypoint.

High voltage powerlines run down from the neighborhood to the towers and along Black Mountain road.
Do not try to cross them without several hundred feet of clearance.
If you cannot make it back to launch, find a park or a train to land on.

If you get pushed over the back you may encounter strong sink trying to get back to launch.
If you can't make it back, there are empty lots and parks in the housing developments that make good LZs.

Airspace: there are a few airspace restrictions in this area.
Stay below 3000ft MSL for this task and don't fly south of the towers.
There is a bit of leeway but remember that Miramar airspace is SFC... and they have guns.

Occasionally, small aircraft will fly through at about 3000ft MSL.
Since they move slowly and the area is wide open, they should have no trouble avoiding you.

Summertime: the thermals can be quite punch midday. Wait until peak heating passes before flying.
At other times of the year launch before peak heating and try staying in the air as the lift improves.

## Tips
When thermalling, see how steeply you can bank your wing and stay in the core.
Thermals at this site tend to be narrower than average because of the location.

It is often a good idea to push out in front to find thermals and track them up the ridge so that
you don't end up drifting over the back.

When gliding into a headwind, use as much speedbar as necessary to maximize your glide ratio.
When coming back from the ball fields fly more slowly to take advantage of the tailwind.

*Can I make it?* Pick a fixed point on your harness and compare it to your destination.
I usually use my carabiners, but you can use your flight deck or the tip of your pod.
In your field of view is it moving up or down? If it's moving up you will fly over the destination,
otherwise you will end up walking there instead.

In this task all waypoints except the ball field are thermal triggers within glide of each other.
This will not be true for all tasks. You may need to veer off of the course line to maintain altitude.

## Comments
Little Black can be frustrating even for experienced pilots because of unpredictable flush cycles.
Don't be surprised if you hear voluminous swearing from above while hiking up.
Even if you launch into a good cycle, there's no guarantee that another one will roll through
before you end up in the LZ. Be prepared to hike and relaunch. Keep extra snacks and water in your car.

Overall though, it's a good site for simultaneous thermal and cardio training.
