# Motivation
### Progression after Certification

* Lots of resources &mdash; little guidance
* Most information is about paragliding in general
* Site guides written by and for experienced pilots
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">
* Today I want to talk about progression
* Specifically during the period after pilots obtain P3 certification
* Expand on an idea for getting the community to fill in the gaps

As a new P3...

* There are a lot of resources out there
* But there's no longer an instructor guiding you at every step
* Lacking the structure of certification guidelines

However

* Everyone learns at a different pace
* Some people are good at muddling through on their own
* Others need more structure

* So, are you on your own?

[x] Attrition rate is high in paragliding

# Paragliding Community

* Help newer pilots develop necessary skills
* Ensure safety and fun for all participants
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">
* The paragliding community is here for you
* Feel free to ask around for advice
* Nobody is going to think less of you
* Everyone is willing to share things they've picked up through the years

</div>

# Existing Resources

* Books &amp; Videos
* Sprints &amp; Clinics
* Mentors
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">
* Books &amp; Videos
  * A lot of good information
  * General knowledge
  * Not tailored to site or even a region
  * Not obvious for newer pilots how to incorporate these insights
* Clinics and Sprints
  * Lots of fun
  * Good for breaking through roadblocks
  * Long gap between attending them
  * Expensive
* Mentorship
  * Best if available
  * Fill in gaps left by instructors
  * Does not scale well
  * Effort intensive
  * Depends on the physical availability of volunteers

<div class="markdown">
# Proposal

* Pilot program
* Collection of small tasks
* Tailored for sites in SoCal
* Focus on building specific skills
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">

* To address shortcomings, a little experiment

* Small tasks alone relatively pointless
* Task is merely a context
  * Familiarity with site beyond site guides
  * Improving specific skills

* Experimentation is the key to growth
* Tasks inspire to try new things or doing things differently

# Website
[ParaTasker](https://paratasker.netlify.com/)

* [Open source](https://github.com/patonw/paratasker)
* Static hosting

No programming needed to create and modify tasks

Tasks written in *mostly* plain text
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">
TODO a screenshot

* Because... why not?

# Website demo

* Tasks organized by level and site
* Skill levels don't have an intrisic meaning
* Relative measure compared to other tasks
* Use levels to group tasks of similar difficulty

* Measure of what's appropriate to your skill level
* You'll be able to see things you can achieve safely
* Or challenge yourself to fly slightly beyond your skill level
</div>
</div>

<div id="tasks" class="step slide" data-rel-x="1200" data-rel-y="200">

# Task format

* Closed circuit
* Repeatable
* Time boxed
* Skill level
</div>
<div class="notes markdown">
*Walk through example task*

Task details

* Map
* Waypoints
* Task route
* Objectives
  * Things you should learn from attempting the task
* Description
  * Detailed walkthrough about what to expect on each leg
* Hazards
  * Some are general hazards
  * Or just things beyond your skill level
